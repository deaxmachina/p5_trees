# Trees and CO2 in the air

## Description
- Little side project ðŸ’–. 
- Visualisation of the effect of number of trees on the CO2 levels in the atmosphere in a closed system.
- I made this project to learn p5.js and more about the relationship between trees and CO2 in the air. Thanks to my wonderful partner, who collected the data for me, I was able to learn quite a lot about this interesting topic.
